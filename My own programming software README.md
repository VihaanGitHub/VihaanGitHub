//Basics 
<br><br>
The print function allows you to print text. The Image function allows you to paste an image link.
The "DS" Function basicly allows you to put a link in your website. The link should be: https://www.(the name of the website)
 .com/.co/.in/.org, And the "display" is how the name of the link will show on display.
  Form is the login form/Sign in form, for a password put: Password, for an E-Mail put: e-mail, for a username put: Text.
  The "blind spot" is the placeholder, and required means that you cant submit without filling the 
  field, The requirements are the things that you HAVE to put at a certain place, For Example:
  @Gmail.com (at the END of an E-Mail) One capital letter (at the START of a password).
  Server vote means that you can view other peoples projects.
  Circumstance means that the action will only happen at a particular moment.
  "Ref" means that you can paste the link of ANYTHING. 
  <br><br>
Advanced:
  the Zoom In allows you to zoom in by a number In or out.
  The Coded real time means that you can see other peoples stuff in real time.
  Needs to means that a function needs to occour before another one can be executed.
  "Allow to change by" Means that you can edit or create something optionaly (Its not required).
  "Capture from main: Home screen" means that it will take your home screen data and IMPLEMENT it into the server.
  "word said: {watched on" means that if something is said or played it will be changed, for Example: A voice changer.
  "AND,OR,NOR,XOR and XNOR mean: And: Only one, Or: Any one, Nor: No one, Xor: A specific one,
  Xnor: A specific one that you cant do.
  Binary is something that the computer understands,Binary is composed
  of only 0s and 1s, For Example: 1:0000 2:0001 3: 0010 4: 0011 5: 0100 6: 0110 7:0111 8:1000 9: 1001 10:1010 11:1011
  12: 1100 13: 1110 14: 1111 etc.
  To and from takes to or from.
  Y,Z and X axis are rotation directions.
 = means allow, ≠ means deny and ≈ means choose.
  property ≠ direct by action means 
  that you cant save your game,
  to have to save it put:=, and for
  the user being able to choose if they want to save it or not put:≈.
process-location means that it can save your location {in game or out game}.
list game{input-Allow account location means that, you will get the option to let the game use your
  account or not, "list game" is the popup message, "allow account"
  is the location tracker and,
  "input" is what will it do if the
  user did not allow the game to track thier location.
  Voice session is, (0 acts: ≈)
  that means that if you speak 0 times you have to choose if you want to triger the voice assistance, (1 act: =) that means that if you triger the assistant 1 time it will turn ON and, (3 acts: ≠) this means that if you triger the assistant 3 times IN A ROW then it will turn off.
  selective choices mean that you can choose what and what not to do.
  function chooses a command to implement in real time.
  "developer command" is like a vector, it takes data and confirms more of it and then it categorizes the data.
  style of letter includes:
  strikethrough (-------)
  italics: (///////////)
  bold: (••••••••••••)
  and, Underlined (____________)
  underestimate by means that if a command with less or more value is implemented, the vector will sort them out: Overestimate (Higher) 
  Underestimate (Lower)
  The "Understand" allows a vector to sort it out.
  "Substantial connectivity" means
  that the game can tell the real 
  life time if the users internet
  is on. "UTC" is international and
  "LTC" is local.
  Include custom allows a vector to be stopped by a user.
  Import time: Time sleep () means that you will have to wait a few seconds before a command can be implemented, put the time in the brackets.
  By using the "import file" you can create, Show, or customize a file.
  reality in program is PIP (picture in picture)
  Import favicon puts an image next to the name of your website (logo)
  3D+ Means that many frames can be operated and changed every 1/24th of a second, use *keyframes to make the frames into 1 big animation.
  Comp means Computer
  Delay means that there can be a 
  delay between the frames, lowering the frame rate.
  There is lastly an empty paragraph which you can put anything in.
 Operator control is how to make money from the server. 
  <br><br>
Structures, Attributes, Commands and Controls:
  Structures are: Structure,Structural start and
  Structural Print, These functions create more code called commands.
  Commands are: Example: Image Command, Commands tell the computer do directly 
  do a function and commands create attributes.
  Attributes are: Example: Blind Spot Attribute, Attributes
  are found inside of commands and they style a command to create a control.
  Controls are: Example: Ref Control, They are powered by attributes
  and style the attributes
  <br><br>
Scores:
  (- This is called a starting score,
  Only commands that have attributes start with a starting score.
  {- This is called a secondary score,
  This is found after the starting score.
  [- This is called the third score,
  It is used after the Secondary score.
  < - This is called a fourth score,
     It is used after the third score.
     ~ <- this is called the last score,
  It is used after the fourth score.
  )- This is called the ending score,
  it ends the commands that have a starting score.
