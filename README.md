//Basics 
<br><br>
The print function allows you to print text. The Image function allows you to paste an image link.
The "DS" Function basicly allows you to put a link in your website. The link should be: https://www.(the name of the website)
 .com/.co/.in/.org, And the "display" is how the name of the link will show on display.
  Form is the login form/Sign in form, for a password put: Password, for an E-Mail put: e-mail, for a username put: Text.
  The "blind spot" is the placeholder, and required means that you cant submit without filling the 
  field, The requirements are the things that you HAVE to put at a certain place, For Example:
  @Gmail.com (at the END of an E-Mail) One capital letter (at the START of a password).
  Server vote means that you can view other peoples projects.
  Circumstance means that the action will only happen at a particular moment.
  "Ref" means that you can paste the link of ANYTHING. 
  <br><br>
Advanced:
  the Zoom In allows you to zoom in by a number In or out.
  The Coded real time means that you can see other peoples stuff in real time.
  Needs to means that a function needs to occour before another one can be executed.
  "Allow to change by" Means that you can edit or create something optionaly (Its not required).
  "Capture from main: Home screen" means that it will take your home screen data and IMPLEMENT it into the server.
  "word said: {watched on" means that if something is said or played it will be changed, for Example: A voice changer.
  "AND,OR,NOR,XOR and XNOR mean: And: Only one, Or: Any one, Nor: No one, Xor: A specific one,
  Xnor: A specific one that you cant do.
  Binary is something that the computer understands,Binary is composed
  of only 0s and 1s, For Example: 1:0000 2:0001 3: 0010 4: 0011 5: 0100 6: 0110 7:0111 8:1000 9: 1001 10:1010 11:1011
  12: 1100 13: 1110 14: 1111 etc.
  To and from takes to or from.
  Y,Z and X axis are rotation directions.
 = means allow, ≠ means deny and ≈ means choose.
  <br><br>
Structures, Attributes, Commands and Controls:
  Structures are: Structure,Structural start and
  Structural Print, These functions create more code called commands.
  Commands are: Example: Image Command, Commands tell the computer do directly 
  do a function and commands create attributes.
  Attributes are: Example: Blind Spot Attribute, Attributes
  are found inside of commands and they style a command to create a control.
  Controls are: Example: Ref Control, They are powered by attributes
  and style the attribute.
  <br><br>
Scores:
  (- This is called a starting score,
  Only commands that have attributes start with a starting score.
  {- This is called a secondary score,
  This is found after the starting score.
  [- This is called the third score,
  It is used after the Secondary score.
  < - This is called a fourth score,
     It is used after the third score.
     ~ <- this is called the last score,
  It is used after the fourth score.
  )- This is called the ending score,
  it ends the commands that have a starting score.
